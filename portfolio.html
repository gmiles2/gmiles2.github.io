        <h2>Week 1 - Setting up and embedding two charts</h2>

        <h3>Size of the UK Economy</h3>
        <p>This is an interactive graph displaying the nominal GDP of the UK economy 
            for between 1955 and 2021.
        </p>

        <div class="chart" id="Vis1"></div>
        

        <h3>Korea's Ageing Population</h3>
        <p>The share of the population who are older than 65 has risen from 3% to 
            16% in the last 60 years. The figure below shows Koreas populaton is expected to
            continue to age until around 35% of the population is 65 or older.

        <h2>Week 2 - Making two charts</h2>


        <h3>A chart on outstanding IMF lending</h3>
        <div class ="chart" id="Vis3"></div>

        <h3>Improvement of the Financial Times graph</h3>
        <div class="chart" id="Vis4"></div>
        <p>This second graph clearly shows that in 1984 the amount of IMF lending
            as a percentage of global GDP was considerably higher at 0.31 percent,
            compared to 0.10 percent in 2022. Therefore, we can conlude that even
            though the debt taken on by the IMF has increased over this period, at the same time global GDP has risen by 
            a larger proportion. </p>
